Java's Builtin heap is the PriorityQueue.

Main differences between hashmap and hashset: hashmap implements a map 
interface where hashset implements a set interface and hashmap stores values
in relation to their keys whereas hashset just stores a set of values.

put() : hashmap is slightly slower than treemap
containsKey() : treemap is slightly slower than hashmap
containsValue() : treemap is significantly slower than hashmap
get() : treemap is slightly faster
remove() : treemap is significantly slower than hashmap
